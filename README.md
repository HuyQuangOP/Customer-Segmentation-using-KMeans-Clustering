# Customer-Segmentation-using-K-Means-Clustering
This project used K-Means Clustering and RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis to segment customers from a retail chain store database provided by Soibien. Since K-Means Clustering is a distance-based model, data normalization was necessary. Normalization ensures all variables (Recency, Frequency, Monetary in this case) contribute equally to the distance calculations used for clustering, especially when dealing with customer behavior which can vary greatly and may contain outliers.

A ranking and scoring system was applied to the RFM data to segment customers. The optimal number of customer groups was determined to be 5. The model was then trained, and a 3D visualization was created to explore the distribution of the customer segments.

Software used: Python
